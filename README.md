# My Resume

This is my resume website I built using React with Typescript and Material-UI.

It holds links to contact me on various platforms and shows some recent projects.

Deployed at [www.theriake.ca](https://www.theriake.ca)

I plan to make this a template which can be updated with simple JSON to allow anyone to use it more easily.
